GENERAL INFORMATION1. Title of Dataset: Hidden Barriers: The Experience of Academic Librarians and Archivists with Invisible Illnesses and/or Disabilities Dataset2. Description or abstract of dataset: This study seeks to identify barriers to academic librarianship for LIS professionals with invisible illnesses and/or disabilities. A survey of MLIS-holding librarians who live with invisible illness(es) and/or disabilities examined the impact of illness or disability on work, disclosure, and potential stigma within workplace culture. Results indicate cultures do not allow for open disclosure and hinder access to the federally-protected accommodations process, ultimately demonstrating an inequitable and inaccessible field. This dataset features the raw data from the questions. All other and textual answers have been removed to protect participant anonymity.3. Author Information	A.

Description of methods used for collection/generation of data: <Include links or references to publications or other documentation containing experimental design or protocols used in data collection>The 30-question survey employed a short demographic section to collect background information of respondents, followed by a series of single-answer multiple choice questions, Likert scale questions, and matrix questions. Respondents were allowed opportunities to elaborate on some questions through open-ended responses. We refrained from including multiple open-ended questions in an effort to keep the survey short; as respondents live with invisible disabilities, this may reduce a person's energy level.2. Methods for processing the data: <describe how the submitted data were generated from the raw or collected data>Quantitative data was largely analyzed through descriptive statistics. The attached spreadsheet was generated by Qualtrics. 3. Instrument- or software-specific information needed to interpret the data: <include full name and version of software, and any necessary packages or libraries needed to run scripts>Qualtrics4.

Number of variables: 60 columns2. Number of cases/rows: Responses varied based upon different questions and experiences of respondents but the overall response rate was 359. Fifty-nine respondents were disqualified due to either not working in an academic library or not identifying as having an invisible disability, leaving our primary sample size to be 300. The only required questions were the initial qualifying questions, the remainder of the questions were optional and respondents could choose to respond or skip different questions based upon their experiences.3.
