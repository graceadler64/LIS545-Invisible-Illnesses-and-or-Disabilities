This document describes the files in this repository. This is a repository that compiles and curates the files of the Hidden Barriers: The Experience of Academic Librarians and Archivists with Invisible Illnesses and/or Disabilities Dataset in order to practice data curation in a graduate setting. This is performed for education purposes only. No ownership, distribution, or contribution to the original data set is claimed by the repository creator.

A. Data set files

A.1. IID Data.csv: This is the raw data file. It is a singular CSV file organized by columns per question, with a total of about 60 variables and 359 respondants. 

From the IID Readme.txt (2023): "This study seeks to identify barriers to academic librarianship for LIS professionals with invisible illnesses and/or disabilities. A survey of MLIS-holding librarians who live with invisible illness(es) and/or disabilities examined the impact of illness or disability on work, disclosure, and potential stigma within workplace culture. Results indicate cultures do not allow for open disclosure and hinder access to the federally-protected accommodations process, ultimately demonstrating an inequitable and inaccessible field. This dataset features the raw data from the questions."

A.2. IID Readme.txt: This is the original ReadMe file from the dataset as hosted on FigShare: https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Hidden_Barriers_The_Experience_of_Academic_Librarians_and_Archivists_with_Invisible_Illnesses_and_or_Disabilities_Dataset/17161328?file=31767911
